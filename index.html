<h2>About Me</h2>
<section>
  <p style="font-size:125%">
    Name: Emily Taylor <br>
    Year: Senior <br>
    Major: Computer Science BS <br>
    Concentration: Software Engineering <br>
  </p>
  <p style="font-size:125%">
    I am a undergraduate at the University of Delaware pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a 
    concentration in Software Engineering. I am looking for entry level positions, especially in Software 
    Engineering or other related roles. I recently joined the Sensify research labs at UD, and Iâ€™ve been 
    developing and optimizing the procedural generation of character data using C# in Unity3D. The data will 
    be used to train deep learning models that will rapidly generate interesting and dynamic video game 
    characters with a long-term goal to explore character-based creativity support tools that integrate well 
    into game development practices and workflows. During the semester, I work on the ECE/CIS Labstaff, which 
    supports the Electrical and Computer Engineering and Computer Information Systems departments and their 
    faculty. As part of my job, I often respond to posts in the ticket system in order to resolve individual 
    issues, as well as, work with other members of the Labstaff on more long term projects. Outside of class, 
    I am involved in a number of student organizations both pertaining to Computer Science and not. I am the 
    treasurer for the CS+ Social Good organization, which focuses on outreach and other ways to give back 
    through Computer Science.
